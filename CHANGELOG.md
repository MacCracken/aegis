## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.3] — 2026-05-10

**P(-1) hardening pass — boundary validation against the 2024-2026 CVE landscape.** Six security-class fixes (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, F-8) closed at the API boundary. Three findings (F-6 TOCTOU, F-7 Unicode quarantine bypass, F-9 sentinel audit) deferred to 0.9.4 with concrete plans. Full audit report at [`docs/audit/2026-05-10-audit.md`](docs/audit/2026-05-10-audit.md). Tests **303 passed / 0 failed** (was 274; +7 new test groups, +29 new assertions). API surface unchanged (151 public fns) — all new helpers are `_aegis_*` private.

### Security

- **F-1 (MEDIUM, CWE-770)** — Unbounded `max_events` from JSON deserialization could request arbitrary heap alloc via `aegis_ring_new(cap*8)`. **Fixed**: `AEGIS_MAX_EVENTS_HARD_CAP = 1_000_000` (8 MB ring upper bound) clamp at JSON deserialization AND at `aegis_config_set_max_events` setter (defense-in-depth).
- **F-2 (HIGH, CWE-77)** — `aegis_isolate_agent` / `aegis_rate_limit_agent` interpolated `agent_id` into nftables table names + rule comments without validation. nein's `validate_identifier` only fired at `firewall_validate` time, after the firewall was built. **Fixed**: `_aegis_valid_agent_id` whitelist `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{1,54}$` at the firewall builder seam — categorically rejects iptables-save comment-injection class (Shielder 2024) and every Unicode confusable / zero-width / control codepoint (CVE-2024-43093 class). Builders return `0` (null fw) on invalid input.
- **F-3 (HIGH, CWE-77)** — Same builders accepted `agent_addr` raw; nein doesn't validate the addr format. **Fixed**: `_aegis_valid_agent_addr` shape validator (`[0-9a-fA-F:./]`, length 1..43) at the seam. Rejects every nftables-injection vector (whitespace, braces, semicolons, newlines, quotes, comment markers). Typed parse + canonical re-emit deferred to 0.9.5.
- **F-4 (LOW, CWE-690)** — `auto_release_timeout_secs` from JSON accepted negatives other than the `-1` sentinel → past epoch + immediate auto-release on next `aegis_check_auto_releases`. **Fixed**: clamp to `{-1} ∪ [0, AEGIS_TIMEOUT_HARD_CAP]` (1 year of seconds).
- **F-5 (LOW)** — `periodic_scan_interval_secs` unbounded. **Fixed**: clamp to `[0, AEGIS_TIMEOUT_HARD_CAP]`.
- **F-8 (HIGH, CWE-674, partial fix)** — `lib/json.cyr`'s typed-value parser is recursive without a depth cap; deeply nested input could exhaust the stack (CVE-2025-52999 Jackson class). **Partial fix**: 256 KB input-length cap (`AEGIS_JSON_MAX_BYTES = 262_144`) at all 8 `*_from_json` seams bounds worst-case nesting at ~131K nodes, well past stack-exhaustion territory. A real depth cap upstream in `lib/json.cyr` (suggest 32 — record nesting in aegis is shallow) tracked for 0.9.5.

### Deferred to 0.9.4 (concrete plans, not skipped)

- **F-6 (HIGH, CWE-367)** — TOCTOU + symlink follow in scanner. `_aegis_stat_modesize` uses `sys_stat` (follows symlinks); the canonical anti-pattern from CVE-2025-2425 (ESET) / CVE-2025-22224 (VMware) / CVE-2024-50379 (Tomcat). 0.9.4 cheap fix: switch to `sys_lstat`, surface symlinks as findings rather than silently following. 0.9.5 deeper fix: rework around `sys_open(O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC) → sys_fstat(fd)`. Why deferred: needs symlink test plumbing + new syscall surface.
- **F-7 (MEDIUM)** — Unicode-normalization quarantine bypass. The cstr-keyed quarantine map does byte-for-byte comparison; an attacker can use case variants, U+2011 hyphens, zero-width inserts, RTL overrides to register multiple "different" agents (CVE-2024-43093 class). 0.9.3 firewall-path validators block this on the firewall side (whitelist is ASCII-only); the in-memory quarantine map remains exposed. 0.9.4 fix: reuse `_aegis_valid_agent_id` on `aegis_quarantine_agent` / `aegis_release_agent` / `aegis_is_quarantined` / `aegis_get_quarantine` / `security_event_new`. Why deferred: API-contract change (existing consumers may pass weird IDs); needs `### Breaking` migration note.
- **F-9 (MEDIUM, CWE-690)** — Sentinel audit pass. ADR 0001 documented per-field `-1` / `0` / `QA_NONE` choices; risk is preventive — future fields added without going through the ADR may collide. 0.9.4: annotate every sentinel use with classification, re-evaluate at v1.0 freeze.

### Added

- `docs/audit/` directory + first audit report at `2026-05-10-audit.md` — 9 findings, severity-tagged, with concrete remediation per finding and `What aegis got right` section recording load-bearing audit-clean properties.
- `_aegis_valid_agent_id` / `_aegis_valid_agent_addr` validators in `src/firewall.cyr`.
- `_aegis_clamp_max_events` / `_aegis_clamp_interval_secs` / `_aegis_clamp_auto_release_timeout` / `_aegis_json_size_ok` helpers in `src/lib.cyr`.
- 7 new test groups in `tests/aegis.tcyr` covering each of the 6 fixes (F-2/F-3 share validators so + a regression-guard "valid input still accepted" group): **+29 assertions**, total **303 passed / 0 failed**.

### Verification

- `scripts/audit.sh` green end-to-end.
- API surface snapshot unchanged at 151 public fns (helpers are private; no contract change).
- `scripts/check-api-surface.sh`: `ok: 151 public fns, surface matches snapshot exactly`.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-10

**V1 prep — last work before the 1.0.0 cut.** Lands the four remaining v1 deliverables that don't require external consumers to ship: an API-surface CI gate, a doc-health ledger, a polished README API list, and an example consumer that exercises the public surface end-to-end. After this, 1.0.0 is a clean review/audit pass — no new functionality.

### Added

- **`scripts/check-api-surface.sh`** — thin wrapper around `cyrius api-surface --scope=project --snapshot=...`. Pattern lifted from agnosys; the cyrius CLI does the heavy lifting. Usage: `./scripts/check-api-surface.sh` (diff vs. committed snapshot) or `--update` (regenerate after intentional surface changes). Exits non-zero on drift.
- **`docs/development/api-surface-1.0.snapshot`** — committed v1.0 baseline. **151 public fns** across 2 modules: 146 in `lib`, 5 in `firewall`. CI gate fails on unannounced additions/removals.
- New CI step **API surface (drift gate)** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, between Vet and Build. Same gate added to `scripts/audit.sh` so local audits catch drift before push.
- **`docs/doc-health.md`** — living ledger of doc currency. Tier the 18-file aegis surface (6 root + 12 under `docs/`) into fresh / stale / read-through / evergreen / archive / open-question buckets. Refreshed in place when docs are touched. Pattern lifted from `agnosys/docs/doc-health.md`, right-sized for aegis's smaller surface.
- **`docs/examples/basic_consumer.cyr`** — small standalone consumer (~60 LOC) that exercises the public surface end-to-end: `aegis_new` → report a Critical event → auto-quarantine triggers → `aegis_isolate_agent` builds the firewall → `aegis_firewall_render` + `aegis_firewall_validate`. Builds with `cyrius build`; prints a one-line summary on success. Stand-in for the v1 deliverable "one downstream consumer green" until daimon / argonaut land — proves nothing essential is private-by-accident.

### Changed

- `README.md` — API list polished to cover all 151 public fns: added Firewall (nein integration) section, Ring primitive subsection (cross-ref'd to ADR 0005), JSON serde paragraph, pointer to the machine-checkable snapshot. Documentation index gains entries for `docs/doc-health.md` + `docs/examples/`.
- `docs/development/roadmap.md` — V1 prep deliverables marked shipped under 0.9.2; M10 (1.0.0) reframed as "clean review/audit before cut" with a concrete sign-off checklist (audit green / snapshot matches / doc-health zero stale rows / ADRs Accepted / `001-cyrius-port-gaps` zero deferred / example builds). "Real downstream consumer integration" moved to deferred-post-1.0.

### Notes

- **Lint warnings: 0** on every source file — the v1-prep "address every warning" deliverable trivially holds at the 0.9.2 baseline (recorded in `doc-health.md`).
- API freeze policy starts at 1.0.0: snapshot additions are non-breaking; removals or renames need a major bump.

### Alignment with first-party standards

- `docs/architecture/cyrius-port-gaps.md` renamed to **`docs/architecture/001-cyrius-port-gaps.md`** to follow the `NNN-kebab-case-title.md` convention from [first-party-documentation.md § Architecture Notes](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/planning/first-party-documentation.md#architecture-notes). All references updated (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, ADR 0002 + 0005, `doc-health.md`, `roadmap.md`, `src/lib.cyr` header). `docs/architecture/README.md` index populated (was previously "Empty").
- **`CLAUDE.md` rewritten to align with `example_claude.md`** — Genesis repo link added to Project Identity, new Scaffolding section (project ported via `cyrius port`; rust-old retired in 0.6.0; firewall.rs.ref retired in 0.9.1), new Process section with Hardening (P(-1)) / Work Loop / Closeout Pass shaped to aegis's actual cadence, "Read the genesis repo's CLAUDE.md first" added as a hard rule, ADR cross-refs added to Key Principles. Durable content preserved; no volatile state inlined.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-10

**Rust scaffold fully retired.** With the firewall port shipped in 0.9.0, the last remaining piece of the original rust source — `docs/reference/firewall.rs.ref`, preserved through 0.5–0.8.x as the parity oracle for the deferred nein integration — is no longer load-bearing. This release deletes it along with the "do not modify the rust spec" guidance and the dangling references in CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md / SECURITY.md / README.md / docs / inline comments. No source or behaviour change to the daemon library; tests still **274 passed / 0 failed**.

### Removed

- `docs/reference/firewall.rs.ref` — last file from the rust scaffold; preserved through 0.5–0.8.x as the parity oracle for nein integration. The cyrius port in 0.9.0 made it redundant.
- `/rust-old/target/` from `.gitignore` — `rust-old/` itself was deleted in 0.6.0; the gitignore line had been stale since.
- "Do not modify the frozen rust spec" rule in `CLAUDE.md`.
- "Outstanding rust surface" callout in `README.md` (status paragraph also refreshed from 0.8.2 → 0.9.0); `docs/reference/` removed from the project-layout tree.
- "Out of scope: firewall integration" bullet in `SECURITY.md` — no longer accurate since 0.9.0.
- "`rust-old/src/lib.rs` is the parity oracle" guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; cyrius pin reference bumped to `5.10.34`; `src/firewall.cyr` added to the "make your change in the right place" map.
- `rust-old/` from the `docs/guides/getting-started.md` layout; "cross-check parity against rust-old/" step dropped.

### Changed

- `docs/architecture/001-cyrius-port-gaps.md` header note rewritten — the rust source is fully gone. The `nein` row updated from "deferred" to "done in 0.9.0".
- `docs/development/state.md` — version line and source list refreshed; bullet for the deleted reference file dropped.
- `src/firewall.cyr` header comment — removed the pointer at the deleted spec; replaced with a self-contained note that consumers (daimon) read the wire shape, so changes are breaking.
- 5 inline `# Mirrors rust-old…` / `# matches … in rust-old/src/lib.rs` comments in `src/lib.cyr` rewritten to describe the behaviour without dangling at deleted paths.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-10

**Nein firewall integration — `QA_ISOLATE` / `QA_RATELIMIT` are real now.** The deferred-since-0.5 firewall enforcement path lands as `src/firewall.cyr`, a faithful port of the frozen rust spec at `docs/reference/firewall.rs.ref`. nein dependency added at `[deps.nein]` = `1.5.0` (cyrius `5.10.34`). Three public builders + a render + validate wrapper; tests mirror the six `#[cfg(test)]` cases from the rust spec. Wire-level diffs against the rust output are zero (table-name prefixes `aegis_iso_` / `aegis_rl_` / `aegis_host` and rule comments preserved verbatim). Total tests: **274 passed / 0 failed** (was 256).

### Added

- `[deps.nein]` in `cyrius.cyml` — git/path/tag pointing at nein 1.5.0, pulls `dist/nein.cyr` (single-file bundle) plus the transitive `dist/agnosys-core.cyr` it requires.
- `src/firewall.cyr` — three public builders + two passthrough wrappers:
  - `aegis_isolate_agent(agent_id_cstr, agent_addr_cstr) → fw*` — drops all traffic to/from the agent address (inet table `aegis_iso_<agent_id>`, input + output chains, drop verdicts with `aegis isolate <agent_id>` comments).
  - `aegis_rate_limit_agent(agent_id_cstr, agent_addr_cstr, pps) → fw*` — accept up to `pps` packets/second (burst = `2*pps`), drop the rest. Symmetric on input + output. Comments `aegis rate-limit <agent_id>` / `aegis rate-limit drop <agent_id>`.
  - `aegis_hardened_host() → fw*` — baseline host posture: input default drop with allow-established/loopback/SSH/ICMP-echo carve-outs; output accept; forward drop. Table `aegis_host`.
  - `aegis_firewall_render(fw) → Str*` — passthrough to `firewall_render` so consumers can grab nftables source via the aegis surface.
  - `aegis_firewall_validate(fw) → i64` — converts nein's tagged `Result` (`Ok(0)` / `Err(code)`) to aegis's boundary convention: `0 = ok, 1 = invalid`.
- 6 new test groups in `tests/aegis.tcyr` (18 assertions): isolate/rate-limit/hardened-host × renders + validates. Each render assertion checks specific nftables clauses that match the rust spec's `assert!(rendered.contains(...))` calls verbatim.

### Architecture

- `src/main.cyr` now `include`s both `src/lib.cyr` and `src/firewall.cyr`. The new module is independent of the daemon record — it's a sibling slice of the public API, mirroring the rust spec's standalone-function shape. Coupling firewall generation into `aegis_quarantine_agent` would require adding an `agent_addr` to the `QuarantineEntry` record; the rust spec deliberately kept these decoupled (aegis decides the action, the consumer applies the ruleset with addresses it owns), so we follow suit.

### Notes

- Out-of-scope items from the prior 0.9.0 plan (API surface snapshot script + CI gate, full audit pass, doc polish, one downstream consumer green) shift to 0.10.x. The API snapshot in particular needed nein to land first — without it, `aegis_quarantine_agent` with `QA_ISOLATE` / `QA_RATELIMIT` was placeholder behaviour, and freezing a placeholder surface would have been wire-meaningless.
- nein pulls in `lib/agnosys-core.cyr` as a transitive dep (its own `[deps.agnosys]`). aegis doesn't reference any agnosys-core symbols directly; DCE drops everything not transitively reachable from `main`.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-05-10

**Toolchain + dependency refresh.** Cyrius pin moves to `5.10.34`; agnostik dep tag moves to `1.2.1` (was `1.0.0`). The `lib/` tree is now gitignored and repopulated by `cyrius deps` from the version-pinned snapshot — matches the agnosys/agnostik convention and prevents stale stubs from a prior cyrius version sitting in tree. CI and release workflows install the toolchain into `~/.cyrius/versions/<V>/{bin,lib}` with symlinks, which cc5 5.10.9+ requires for arch-peer include resolution (e.g. `syscalls_x86_64_linux.cyr`). No source / behaviour change.

### Changed

- `cyrius.cyml [package].cyrius` — `5.10.0` → `5.10.34`.
- `cyrius.cyml [deps.agnostik].tag` — `1.0.0` → `1.2.1`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `release.yml` — toolchain install lays out `~/.cyrius/versions/<CYRIUS_VERSION>/{bin,lib}` and symlinks `~/.cyrius/{bin,lib}` to the versioned dir (cc5 5.10.9+ requires the version-pinned layout to find arch-peer includes). `Verify toolchain` stays as a separate step — `>> $GITHUB_PATH` only takes effect on subsequent steps, so inlining `cc5 --version` in the install step reports "cc5: command not found".

### Removed

- `lib/` no longer tracked in git. `cyrius deps` repopulates it from `cyrius.cyml [deps]`. `.gitignore` now lists `/lib/`.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-08

**Polish bucket — closes the remaining 0.8.x backlog.** Real fuzz targets, ADRs for the load-bearing decisions, baseline `bench-history.csv`, and a local `scripts/audit.sh` that mirrors the CI gates. Cyrius pin: `5.10.0`. No behaviour change; the audit script is the only thing consumers see.

### Added

- **`tests/aegis.fcyr` rewritten** as a real fuzz harness. 1000 random-byte iterations (length-explicit `Str` from `random_bytes`, 1–2048 bytes per iter) plus ~30 curated edge-case JSON inputs (empty, `[]`, `null`, malformed objects, wrong-type fields, truncated, whitespace-only) fed to all 8 record-from-json parsers. Pass criterion: process exits 0 within the CI's 10 s timeout — measured ~1 s locally.
- `random` to `[deps].stdlib` (for `random_bytes` from `lib/random.cyr` over `getrandom(2)`).
- **5 ADRs** in `docs/adr/`, all Accepted:
  - `0001` — Sentinel values for absent state (per-field `-1` / `0` / `QA_NONE`, JSON null in/out).
  - `0002` — Cstrs at the API boundary, `Str*` in storage; convert with `str_from`/`str_data` at the seam.
  - `0003` — Integer-array threat counts (5-slot inline) instead of an int-keyed hashmap; PascalCase string keys on the JSON wire.
  - `0004` — `map_new()` (cstr-keyed) is the project default; `map_new_str()` is **not** used in aegis source.
  - `0005` — Fixed-cap ring buffer for the events log; cap captured at `aegis_new` time.
- `bench-history.csv` baseline covering 0.7.0 → 0.8.1 with the three benches (`aegis_next_id`, `security_event_new`, `aegis_report_event`). Schema: `date,version,bench,avg_ns,min_ns,max_ns,iterations,notes`. Future versions append.
- `scripts/audit.sh` — local one-shot equivalent of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: deps, syntax check (`--with-deps`), fmt-diff, lint, vet, DCE build, ELF magic, smoke, tests, fuzz, bench, security pattern scan, doc + version-consistency. Exits non-zero on the first failed gate.

### Notes

- The fuzz harness measures robustness against adversarial input (no crashes). Coverage isn't tracked — cyrius lacks coverage tooling. Each parser sees ~2k random + curated inputs per run.
- `bench-history.csv` is hand-maintained today. A future patch (probably 0.9.x) will add a `scripts/bench.sh` that runs the bench, parses output, and appends a row automatically.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-08

**Ring-buffer for the events log.** Replaces the v0.5–0.8 `vec*` + `_aegis_prune_events` rebuild (O(n) per push at cap) with a fixed-capacity ring (O(1) push, overwrite-oldest). `aegis_report_event` drops from **~220 µs → 4 µs avg at 50k iter** (≈ 55× speedup). Behaviour preserved: same observable order (oldest first), same drop-on-overflow semantics, same `aegis_total_events` answers.

### Added

- `aegis_ring_new(cap) → ring*`, `aegis_ring_push(rb, val)`, `aegis_ring_get(rb, i) → val`, `aegis_ring_len(rb)`, `aegis_ring_cap(rb)`. 32-byte header (slots/cap/head/count) + cap × 8-byte slot array. `cap <= 0` clamps to 1.
- 4 ring-specific test groups: basic push/get, overwrite-oldest at cap, iteration order after wrap, cap clamp. Total: **256 passed / 0 failed** across 73 groups.

### Changed

- `AegisSecurityDaemon.events` is now `ring*` (was `vec*`). Cap is captured from `config.max_events` at `aegis_new` time — runtime changes to `max_events` don't resize an existing daemon's ring (matches typical fixed-cap-ring practice; consumers that need to resize call `aegis_new` again).
- All callers refactored: `aegis_total_events`, `aegis_unresolved_count`, `aegis_recent_events`, `aegis_events_for_agent`, `aegis_events_by_threat`, `aegis_unresolved_events`, `aegis_resolve_event`, `aegis_report_event`. Each `vec_len`/`vec_get` became `aegis_ring_len`/`aegis_ring_get`; `vec_push + _aegis_prune_events` became single `aegis_ring_push`.

### Removed

- `_aegis_prune_events` — superseded by the ring's auto-overwrite. Dead code.

### Notes

- Memory: a daemon at default config now allocates 32 + 10000×8 = 80 KB upfront for the events ring (was: vec growing on demand). For embedded use cases on the small end, lower `max_events` before `aegis_new`.
- `scan_history` is still a `vec` and still grows unbounded — matches the rust-old behaviour. If that becomes a memory concern in production, ring-buffering it is an isolated future change.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-08

**JSON serde for the full record surface.** All 8 records (`SecurityEvent`, `QuarantineEntry`, `SecurityFinding`, `SecurityScanResult`, `AegisConfig`, `KernelTuningRecommendation`, `DatabaseSecurityPolicy`, `AegisStats`) gain `*_to_json` / `*_from_json` with roundtrip tests. Wire format mirrors rust-old's `serde_json` rendering. Cyrius pin: `5.10.0`.

### Added

- `json` to `[deps].stdlib`; `[deps.agnostik].modules` extended to include `src/error.cyr` (agnostik's `src/types.cyr` references `err_invalid_argument` from there in parser paths we don't call; pulling it in silences the link warning).
- 4 enum serde-label round-trips (PascalCase variant names, matching `serde`'s default for unit variants without `#[serde(rename_all = ...)]`):
  - `threat_level_serde` / `threat_level_from_serde` (`Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info`)
  - `event_type_serde` / `event_type_from_serde` (12 variants: `IntegrityViolation` … `DatabaseAccessViolation`)
  - `quarantine_action_serde` / `quarantine_action_from_serde` (`None / Suspend / Terminate / Isolate / RateLimit`)
  - `scan_type_serde` / `scan_type_from_serde` (`OnInstall / OnExecute / Periodic / Manual`)
- jv-tree helpers (`_aegis_jv_set_*`, `_aegis_jv_get_*`) layered over `lib/json.cyr`'s typed-value tree API (`json_v_obj_new`, `json_v_str_new`, `json_v_int_new`, `json_v_bool_new`, `json_v_arr_new`, `json_v_obj_set`, `json_v_arr_push`, `json_v_parse`, `json_v_build`).
- 16 record (de)serializers — for each record, both `<name>_to_json_v(rec) → json_v*` (tree) and `<name>_to_json(rec) → Str` (rendered) plus the parse-side equivalents.
- 16 new test groups, **84 new assertions** covering enum roundtrips, basic record roundtrips, edge cases (`Option::None → null` for `agent_id` / `auto_release_at` / `auto_release_timeout_secs`; nested `metadata` map; vec fields like `events` / `findings` / `kernel_tuning`; nested `threat_counts` object). Total: **239 passed / 0 failed** across 69 test groups.

### Wire format

- Field names: snake_case, exactly as the rust struct fields.
- Enum unit variants: PascalCase variant names.
- Timestamps: RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 strings via `iso8601(epoch)` / `iso8601_parse`.
- `Option<T>`: `null` when None, value otherwise.
- `HashMap<String, String>` (event metadata): nested JSON object.
- `HashMap<ThreatLevel, usize>` (threat counts): nested object with PascalCase keys.

### Notes / lessons

- `lib/json.cyr` has two key conventions, **easy to mix up**: `json_v_obj_set(obj, key, val)` stores `key` as a `Str`; `json_v_obj_get(obj, key)` looks up by **cstr**. Found this the hard way — passing `str_from(key_cstr)` to `obj_get` makes `strlen` walk the Str struct as if it were a cstr, returning a garbage length and silently missing every field. All `_aegis_jv_get_*` helpers pass cstr to `obj_get`; `_aegis_jv_set_*` wrap with `str_from` for `obj_set`.
- `aegis_audit_ddl_operation` and friends already populate `event.metadata` — the new SecurityEvent serde lights that wire path up automatically, so DB audit events ship to consumers as full nested-metadata JSON objects without extra glue.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-08

**Sakshi-full structured logging.** Spans wrap every mutating daemon entry point; severity-tagged logfmt-style messages emit on the major transitions (event reported, auto-quarantine, manual quarantine, release, scan skipped/started, db-integrity findings). Cyrius pin: `5.10.0`.

### Added

- `sakshi` to `[deps].stdlib` (uses the bundled v2.2.3 distribution).
- `_aegis_span_enter` / `_aegis_span_exit` wrappers — gate sakshi spans on the active level (`< SK_INFO` ⇒ skip), so tests/benches at `SK_ERROR` stay quiet without redirecting sakshi's output fd.
- `_aegis_log_emit_{info,warn,debug}` and `_aegis_log_kv_{cstr,str,int}` helpers for logfmt-style `"<msg> key=val key=val"` construction.
- Span + structured logging in 10 daemon entry points: `aegis_report_event`, `aegis_resolve_event`, `aegis_quarantine_agent`, `aegis_release_agent`, `aegis_check_auto_releases`, `aegis_scan_agent`, `aegis_scan_package`, `aegis_check_database_integrity`, `aegis_audit_ddl_operation`, `aegis_report_database_access_violation`. Each public fn is a thin trampoline: `_aegis_span_enter("…") → _<name>_inner(…) → _aegis_span_exit()` so no early-return path leaves the span stack unbalanced.
- `src/main.cyr` initialises sakshi at `SK_INFO` to stderr (operators can switch to a file later via `sakshi_output_file` once a config surface lands).
- Tests + benches set `sakshi_set_level(SK_ERROR)` at startup to keep stderr clean.

### Severity mapping (mirrors prior tracing! macros)

- `INFO` — events reported, agent released, db-integrity findings detected.
- `WARN` — auto-quarantine fires; quarantine-severity event without `agent_id`; manual quarantine.
- `DEBUG` — agent already quarantined (link/update); scan skipped (config disabled); scan started; db-integrity check passed.
- Library code never calls `sakshi_error` / `sakshi_fatal`.

### Notes

- Sakshi v2.2.3's actual severity values are `SK_FATAL=0, SK_ERROR=1, SK_WARN=2, SK_INFO=3, SK_DEBUG=4, SK_TRACE=5` — the comment in `lib/log.cyr` showing the inverse mapping is stale for this version. Filter is `emit if msg_severity ≤ active_level`.
- Bench impact: `aegis_report_event` ≈ 229 µs avg at `SK_ERROR` (no logging fires; the prune-and-rebuild dominates). At `SK_INFO` the per-call cost is dominated by `str_builder_*` + sakshi formatting — defer measurement until the ring-buffer perf fix lands in 0.8.x.
- One bug worth flagging: the wrapper `_aegis_span_exit` initially recursed because of an over-broad replace-all. Fix is documented; the wrapper now correctly delegates to `sakshi_span_exit`.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-08

**Cleanup + real UUIDs.** First post-parity slice. Cyrius pin: `5.10.0`.

### Added

- `[deps.agnostik]` (v1.0.0) — pulls `src/types.cyr` for the audit-reviewed `agent_id_new()` (RFC 4122 v4 over `getrandom` with `/dev/urandom` fallback).
- `_aegis_uuid_to_string(buf16)` — renders agnostik's 16-byte v4 UUID as a 36-char hyphenated lowercase hex string. Heap-allocated per call (no static-buffer aliasing across consecutive ids).

### Changed

- **Event IDs are real v4 UUIDs.** `aegis_next_id()` now produces `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`-shaped strings instead of the placeholder `ev-1` / `ev-2` counter. Wire-format ready; collision-resistant.
- Removed the `_aegis_id_counter` global.

### Removed

- `rust-old/` is gone. `firewall.rs` was relocated to `docs/reference/firewall.rs.ref` as the spec for the (still-deferred) nein integration; the rest of the rust scaffolding (Cargo.lock, Cargo.toml, codecov.yml, deny.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, src/lib.rs, LINES_OF_RUST.txt) was deleted.

### Notes

- Bench impact: `aegis_next_id` ≈ 2 µs avg (was ≈ 1 µs with the counter). Extra microsecond is the `getrandom` syscall + hex formatting — within noise, not worth caching.
- aarch64 cross-build: agnostik's `_fill_random` hardcodes the x86_64 `getrandom` syscall number (318). On aarch64 it would be 278. CI's aarch64 cross-build is best-effort; expect a runtime path issue if the cross-build succeeds and is exercised. Will be addressed when agnostik gains arch dispatch.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-08

**Initial Cyrius release.** Full surface parity with the prior Rust scaffold (`rust-old/src/lib.rs`, 1893 lines). Cyrius pin: `5.10.0`.

### Added

- **Records**: `SecurityEvent` (72 B), `QuarantineEntry` (48 B), `SecurityFinding` (32 B), `SecurityScanResult` (40 B), `AegisConfig` (56 B), `KernelTuningRecommendation` (24 B), `DatabaseSecurityPolicy` (48 B), `AegisStats` (72 B), `AegisSecurityDaemon` (72 B). All accessors, all setters that the rust API exposed.
- **Enums** (integer-constant style): `ThreatLevel`, `SecurityEventType` (12 variants), `QuarantineAction` (with `QA_NONE = 0` so `aegis_report_event` returns action-or-zero), `ScanType`. All have label fns matching rust-old's `Display` / serde rendering.
- **Daemon API** (22 entry points covering all rust-old methods):
  - Event reporting + auto-quarantine: `aegis_new`, `aegis_report_event`.
  - Event queries: `aegis_recent_events`, `aegis_events_for_agent`, `aegis_events_by_threat`, `aegis_unresolved_events`, `aegis_resolve_event`.
  - Counters: `aegis_threat_count`, `aegis_total_events`, `aegis_unresolved_count`.
  - Quarantine management: `aegis_quarantine_agent`, `aegis_release_agent`, `aegis_is_quarantined`, `aegis_get_quarantine`, `aegis_quarantined_agents`, `aegis_check_auto_releases`.
  - Scanning: `aegis_scan_agent`, `aegis_scan_package`.
  - Database surface: `aegis_check_database_integrity`, `aegis_audit_ddl_operation`, `aegis_report_database_access_violation`, `aegis_database_kernel_recommendations`.
  - Snapshot: `aegis_stats`.
- **Tests**: `tests/aegis.tcyr` — 53 test groups, 155 assertions, all passing on `cyrius test`. Inline `_tmp_write` / `_tmp_unlink` helpers cover the empty-binary / world-writable scan-agent paths.
- **Docs**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `docs/architecture/cyrius-port-gaps.md`, `docs/development/state.md`, `docs/development/roadmap.md`.

### Changed

- `cyrius.cyml` `version` is now sourced from `VERSION` via `${file:VERSION}` (single source of truth).

### Notes / Deferred

- **Network enforcement**: `firewall.rs` (rust) is preserved at `rust-old/src/firewall.rs` as the spec; the cyrius port is deferred until [nein](https://github.com/MacCracken/nein) bumps its language pin from `4.5.0` to a current Cyrius release.
- **Counter-backed event IDs**: `aegis_next_id` returns `ev-1`, `ev-2`, etc. To be replaced by [agnostik](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnostik)'s audit-reviewed `agent_id_new()` (RFC 4122 v4 over `getrandom`) post-release.
- **Logging**: ad-hoc `str_builder`-formed messages today. Switching to full sakshi (spans + trace IDs + structured fields) is scoped in `docs/architecture/cyrius-port-gaps.md`.
- **Wire format**: no JSON serde yet. Records are in-process only; per-record `*_to_json` / `*_from_json` hand-rolls land when a consumer needs wire interop.
